These classes represent different types of statements typically found in essays. The classes and their corresponding numeric labels are as follows:\n\n        1. Lead (0): The introductory statement or opening of the essay.\n        2. Position (1): The main argument or stance taken in the essay.\n        3. Evidence (2): Factual information or data supporting an argument.\n        4. Claim (3): A statement that asserts something to be true, typically without providing evidence.\n        5. Concluding Statement (4): The final summary or wrap-up of the essay.\n        6. Counterclaim (5): A statement or position that opposes the initial claim or position.\n        7. Rebuttal (6): A statement that refutes or contradicts a counterclaim.\n\n        The task involves analyzing each segment of a students essay and assigning it to the most appropriate class based on its content and context within the essay.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\nimport os\nimport nltk\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\nfrom datasets import Dataset\nimport transformers\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport spacy\nimport wordcloud\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score\nimport pandas as pd\nimport scipy.sparse as sp\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom gensim.models.doc2vec import Doc2Vec, TaggedDocument\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec\nfrom nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer\nimport pickle","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-08T12:12:20.991084Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-08T12:12:20.991358Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-08T12:13:18.126670Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-08T12:12:20.991333Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-08T12:13:18.125719Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Paths \ntrain_csv = r\"C:\\Semester 2\\NLP\\Final Project\\Data\\train.csv\"\nsub_csv = r\"C:\\Semester 2\\NLP\\Final Project\\Data\\sample_submission.csv\"\ntrain_path = r\"C:\\Semester 2\\NLP\\Final Project\\Data\\train\"\ntest_path = r\"C:\\Semester 2\\NLP\\Final Project\\Data\\test\"","metadata":{},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read the CSV file\ntrain = pd.read_csv(train_csv)\n\n# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame\ntrain.head()","metadata":{},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"execution_count":3,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>discourse_id</th>\n","      <th>discourse_start</th>\n","      <th>discourse_end</th>\n","      <th>discourse_text</th>\n","      <th>discourse_type</th>\n","      <th>discourse_type_num</th>\n","      <th>predictionstring</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>423A1CA112E2</td>\n","      <td>1622627660524</td>\n","      <td>8</td>\n","      <td>229</td>\n","      <td>Modern humans today are always on their phone....</td>\n","      <td>Lead</td>\n","      <td>Lead 1</td>\n","      <td>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 1...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>423A1CA112E2</td>\n","      <td>1622627653021</td>\n","      <td>230</td>\n","      <td>312</td>\n","      <td>They are some really bad consequences when stu...</td>\n","      <td>Position</td>\n","      <td>Position 1</td>\n","      <td>45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>423A1CA112E2</td>\n","      <td>1622627671020</td>\n","      <td>313</td>\n","      <td>401</td>\n","      <td>Some certain areas in the United States ban ph...</td>\n","      <td>Evidence</td>\n","      <td>Evidence 1</td>\n","      <td>60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>423A1CA112E2</td>\n","      <td>1622627696365</td>\n","      <td>402</td>\n","      <td>758</td>\n","      <td>When people have phones, they know about certa...</td>\n","      <td>Evidence</td>\n","      <td>Evidence 2</td>\n","      <td>76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 9...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>423A1CA112E2</td>\n","      <td>1622627759780</td>\n","      <td>759</td>\n","      <td>886</td>\n","      <td>Driving is one of the way how to get around.

They are always on their phone more than 5 hours a day no stop .All they do is text back and forward and just have group Chats on social media. They even do it while driving. They are some really bad consequences when stuff happens when it comes to a phone. Some certain areas in the United States ban phones from class rooms just because of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen people have phones, they know about certain apps that they have .Apps like Facebook Twitter Instagram and Snapchat. So like if a friend moves away and you want to be in contact you can still be in contact by posting videos or text messages. People always have different ways how to communicate with a phone. Phones have changed due to our generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriving is one of the way how to get around. People always be on their phones while doing it. Which can cause serious Problems. That's why there's a thing that's called no texting while driving. That's a really important thing to remember. Some people still do it because they think It's stupid. No matter what they do they still have to obey it because that's the only way how did he save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes on the news there is either an accident or a suicide. It might involve someone not looking where they're going or tweet that someone sent. It either injury or death. If a mysterious number says I'm going to kill you and they know where you live but you don't know the person's contact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,It makes you puzzled and make you start to freak out. Which can end up really badly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhones are fine to use and it's also the best way to come over help. If you go through a problem and you can't find help you ,always have a phone there with you. Even though phones are used almost every day as long as you're safe it would come into use if you get into trouble. Make sure you do not be like this phone while you're in the middle of driving. The news always updated when people do something stupid around that involves their phones. The safest way is the best way to stay safe.    \n"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_sample = train[train['id'] == article_id]\ntrain_sample","metadata":{},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"execution_count":5,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>discourse_id</th>\n","      <th>discourse_start</th>\n","      <th>discourse_end</th>\n","      <th>discourse_text</th>\n","      <th>discourse_type</th>\n","      <th>discourse_type_num</th>\n","      <th>predictionstring</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>423A1CA112E2</td>\n","      <td>1622627660524</td>\n","      <td>8</td>\n","      <td>229</td>\n","      <td>Modern humans today are always on their phone....</td>\n","      <td>Lead</td>\n","      <td>Lead 1</td>\n","      <td>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 1...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>423A1CA112E2</td>\n","      <td>1622627653021</td>\n","      <td>230</td>\n","      <td>312</td>\n","      <td>They are some really bad consequences when stu...</td>\n","      <td>Position</td>\n","      <td>Position 1</td>\n","      <td>45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>423A1CA112E2</td>\n","      <td>1622627671020</td>\n","      <td>313</td>\n","      <td>401</td>\n","      <td>Some certain areas in the United States ban ph...</td>\n","      <td>Evidence</td>\n","      <td>Evidence 1</td>\n","      <td>60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>423A1CA112E2</td>\n","      <td>1622627696365</td>\n","      <td>402</td>\n","      <td>758</td>\n","      <td>When people have phones, they know about certa...</td>\n","      <td>Evidence</td>\n","      <td>Evidence 2</td>\n","      <td>76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 9...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>423A1CA112E2</td>\n","      <td>1622627759780</td>\n","      <td>759</td>\n","      <td>886</td>\n","      <td>Driving is one of the way how to get around.

They are always on their phone more than 5 hours a day no stop .All they do is text back and forward and just have group Chats on social media. They even do it while driving. They are some really bad consequences when stuff happens when it comes to a phone. Some certain areas in the United States ban phones from class rooms just because of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen people have phones, they know about certain apps that they have .Apps like Facebook Twitter Instagram and Snapchat. So like if a friend moves away and you want to be in contact you can still be in contact by posting videos or text messages. People always have different ways how to communicate with a phone. Phones have changed due to our generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriving is one of the way how to get around. People always be on their phones while doing it. Which can cause serious Problems. That's why there's a thing that's called no texting while driving. That's a really important thing to remember. Some people still do it because they think It's stupid. No matter what they do they still have to obey it because that's the only way how did he save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes on the news there is either an accident or a suicide.

If a mysterious number says I'm going to kill you and they know where you live but you don't know the person's contact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,It makes you puzzled and make you start to freak out. Which can end up really badly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhones are fine to use and it's also the best way to come over help. If you go through a problem and you can't find help you ,always have a phone there with you. Even though phones are used almost every day as long as you're safe it would come into use if you get into trouble. Make sure you do not be like this phone while you're in the middle of driving. The news always updated when people do something stupid around that involves their phones.
